## Michael's Testing Branch

### run testing
```
npm run testenv
```

this will open testrpc, deploy the contract, and run the website at localhost:8080
note, you will need to copy the contract address from terminal into compose.vue, and contractinbox.vue where it says to.


I am not sure if the vuex stuff is working as it should be. Stuff is weird right now as I learn how to navigate the murky vue waters.
It is becoming clearer, but stick with me.
