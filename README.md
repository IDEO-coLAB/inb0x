# Component Library Branch

I am building this into the MVP for now, since it allows me to work quickly and see how my scss files are working against the actual product. However, it would be wise to decouple the style guide from the actual product once it is pushed live or even pushed to an MVP.

I have built the entire style guide in the "guide" folder of components, so it should be easily removed

All of the scss files are written firsthand by me (Michael), with the exception of the grid, which I created using IBM's nifty Gridish compiler.
